# Dr_Quine

This is a project in which I made Quines and 2 Quine-variants.
The first one is called Colleen and is a classic Quine that outputs the same text than its own content.
Then there's Grace which creates an exact copy of its content in a file called Grace_kid.
Finally there's Sully which starts with an integer equal to 5. Sully then copies itself in Sully_X with X being the value of the integer, each time decreasing it.

# Usage
You will find a C version and a Python version of those 3 programs.
The C version features a Makefile which will create each respective executable in their folder.
For the Python version, simply run each program with python3.
